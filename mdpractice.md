#The Different Formats possible in Markdown

##Headers
Headers are preceded by hashtags. The more hashtags you use, the lower the level of the heading,

##Lists
###Unordered
*Unordered lists are preceded by an asterisk.
	*They can be formatted to different levels by using the tab key.
###Ordered
1. Ordered lists are preceded by numbers followed by a period.
	*They can also be formatted to different levels by using the tab key.

##Emphasis
*Italicized text is preceded and followed by an asterisk.*
_Note that this effect can also be achieved with one underscore before and after, instead of asterisks"

**Bold text is preceded and followed by two asterisks.**
__Note that this effect can also be achieved by two underscores before and after, instead of the asterisks.__

**Bold and *italic* text can be combined**
***Question - does this mean that three asterisks would work to combine bold and italic?***

My purpose is as follows:
>To use the greater than sign 
>before text in order to make 
>it a quote.
